Week 1: <br>
Created the branch feature_character, added 2 files that contain the template character class with a few setup functions.
With the help of Mr. Redon, setup SDL2 on mac and added that to the Setup_qmake branch.
<br>
<br>
Week 2: <br>
Read the code done by the team leader (following a youtube tutorial) in order to understand SDL2 and the basic architecture. Completed the setup and download of the library on my machine and helped other peers to set it up on theirs.
<br>
<br>
Week 3: <br>
I devoted my time this week to the SDL2 youtube tutorial to further understand the architecture. Moreover, I created a branch and introduced the concept of damage to our player (added as a Stat). This branch was then expanded by Amine and I and we managed to improve this feature.
<br>
<br>
Week 4: <br>
During this week I first fixed what I did in week 3 and made it so that the player takes damage when in colision whith an ennemy and not the opposite, moreover, I implemented a feature where theplayer is invincible for a chosen amount of time after taking melee damage from an ennemy. 
<br>
<br>
Week 5: <br>
Created an item file that is meant to display the items in the inventory. Changed a few functions in the inventory files, added an asset, then I got to a point where it displayed the "Hand" text on the first slot, but more will be done next week in order to complete this feature.
<br>
<br>
Week 6: <br>
During this week I kept my focus on the Items_fix branch, remake of items functionality, and changed a lot of functions and added the class Items, the subclasses Armor, Melee and RangedWeapon. After that, I attempted to adapt it to the currently working inventory, then after a significant step I was able to merge develop (current best branch) into the items_fix branch. We decided to again change some functionalities but overall the structure stayed the same.
