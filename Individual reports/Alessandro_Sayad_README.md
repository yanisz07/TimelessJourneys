Week 1: <br>
Created the branch feature_character, added 2 files that contain the template character class with a few setup functions.
With the help of Mr. Redon, setup SDL2 on mac and added that to the Setup_qmake branch.
<br>
<br>
Week 2: <br>
Read the code done by the team leader (following a youtube tutorial) in order to understand SDL2 and the basic architecture. Completed the setup and download of the library on my machine and helped other peers to set it up on theirs.
<br>
<br>
Week 3: <br>
I devoted my time this week to the SDL2 youtube tutorial to further understand the architecture. Moreover, I created a branch and introduced the concept of damage to our player (added as a Stat). This branch was then expanded by Amine and I and we managed to improve this feature.

<br>
Week 4: <br>
During this week I first fixed what I did in week 3 and made it so that the player takes damage when in colision whith an ennemy and not the opposite, moreover, I implemented a feature where theplayer is invincible for a chosen amount of time after taking melee damage from an ennemy.
