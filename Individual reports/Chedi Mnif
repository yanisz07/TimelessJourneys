I worked on installing SDL2 and understanding the library. 
Week 3 and 4: watched videos regardind the rpg games, modified/add some new functionalities to the health of the players.
I have tried to implement a menu to our game but my game crashed.
This week I'll try to improve some features of the character like his shooting.
I got a task which is to try to developp the inventory, I have been trying to watch some videos but it's hard to find something related to sdl since most of them are done with unreal engine.
