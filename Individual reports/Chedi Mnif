I worked on installing SDL2 and understanding the library. 
Week 3 and 4: watched videos regardind the rpg games, modified/add some new functionalities to the health of the players.
I have tried to implement a menu to our game but my game crashed.
This week I'll try to add some features to the players like a better way for the player to shoot for example.
