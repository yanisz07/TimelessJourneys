week 1: Managed to set up the sdl2 library after struggling for a while. Started to experiement with the functionment of the library to understand how it works.

Week 2: started to work on the menu of the game. First, i managed to make a working menu which opens and closes when the key "m" is pressed. Then, i worked on moving this function onto a seperate file from the main file so that i would be less confusing. I worked in the sub branch feature_menu_wjhileplaying

week 3: been stuck on a bug the whole week which is keeping me from merging my prototype menu from last week with the current developp branch. Also tried helping the game design team to start working on making the menu look better but we have no been able to implement this due to the bug.
