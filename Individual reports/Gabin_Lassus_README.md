week 1: Managed to set up the sdl2 library after struggling for a while. Started to experiement with the functionment of the library to understand how it works.

Week 2: started to work on the menu of the game. First, i managed to make a working menu which opens and closes when the key "m" is pressed. Then, i worked on moving this function onto a seperate file from the main file so that i would be less confusing. I worked in the sub branch feature_menu_wjhileplaying

week 3: been stuck on a bug the whole week which is keeping me from merging my prototype menu from last week with the current developp branch. Also tried helping the game design team to start working on making the menu look better but we have no been able to implement this due to the bug. 

week 4/5/6/7 (including vacation): Did most of my work then. Over the course of those weeks, worked on implementing the menu, as well as the settings, in game menu and game over menu. The work was divided between me and Adan Fihma. Personally, i based myself on the already working menu to implement the settings page, and added two features: a button to change between full screen and windowed mode, and a button to swtich on/off the music. I furthermore added buttons to navigate between the different pages and exit the game with an exit game button.

week 6: added a button in the settings to ajust the music volume with a slider which is connected with the music on/off button so that it ajusts to changes in the music on/off state.
