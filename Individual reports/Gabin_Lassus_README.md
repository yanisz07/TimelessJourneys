week 1: Managed to set up the sdl2 library after struggling for a while. Started to experiement with the functionment of the library to understand how it works.

Week 2: started to work on the menu of the game. First, i managed to make a working menu which opens and closes when the key "m" is pressed. Then, i worked on moving this function onto a seperate file from the main file so that i would be less confusing.
