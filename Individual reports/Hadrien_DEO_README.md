Week 1: I worked on the gamplay mechanics of the player and ennemies 

Week2: I worked on installing SDL2 on my pc and watched tutorials to help me understand this library

Week3: same as Week 2

Week 4 (first week of vacations): 
- I worked first on creating a document summarizing point by point the game design work I had done on player and ennemies and share it to the rest of the group. I have not committed it on github as it is a google docs featuring text and diagrams, which would thus have to be separated into into multiple document in the github. Thus you can find the link to access it right under here (if there is any problem accessing it I am at your entire disposal):

- I also worked on the update function of the Game class. The update function was very long and for the sake clarity I was tasked with separating it into multiple smaller functions. This however brought bugs with the attack of the player which I spent most of the week trying to fix before committing the new update function to the feature_update_function_(based_on_develop_attack) branch.

Week 5 (second week of the vacations): I worked on the attack of the player. As Amine had finished doing the attack of the player in the up, down, and sideways directions I worked on a prototype of attack in the diagonal directions. The attack which Amine had coded made a rectangular collision block spawn in the direction of the attack, for diagonal attacks I made two different blocks spawn forming an angle in the direction of the attack. This was committed in the feature_diagonal_melee_attack.
