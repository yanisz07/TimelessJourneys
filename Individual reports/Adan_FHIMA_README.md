During this week, i edited and animated the movement of the main character of our game. for this week, i am working a basic sword attack as well as installing sdl2 in my computer
During the second week, i am bringing my cntribution into the main code of the game, by editing the menu page
of the project

During weeks 3 and 4, I actively focused on developing the game's menu. Most of my time was dedicated to resolving a bug that prevented the game from functioning properly with my initial implementation. Additionaly, I refined the menu and its buttons, incorporating hover effects . I also supplied the sprites for the game's main character.

During week 5, i have been working on a new feature of the game: the game over screen. additionally i have been fixing some bugs in the setting page.

During Week 6, I provided the sprites for our hero (melee attack, different armor, etc.). I have also finished the 'Game Over' screen, implementing two functional buttons.
i also started to work on the sound design of the game.
