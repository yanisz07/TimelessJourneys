Week 1:
Worked on the creating the inventory system and player statistics with Hiba Lina.

Week 2:
Downloaded SDL2 on my computer

Week 3:
Watched videos and read documentation to understand SDL2

Week 4-5:
Started implementing a chest: added a chest onto the map and made text appear in the console when you press enter and are near the chest. The chest is implemented through a class.

Week 6:
Continued the implemention of the chest: when the player opens the chest, 2 windows appear, one representing the chest, one representing the inventory. In both of those, there are slots that the player can move through (and easily move between the chest and the inventory).

Week 7:
Implemented a second chest and fixed the fact that the player could still move when a chest or the inventory is open.
