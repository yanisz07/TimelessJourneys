Week1: I spent most of the time installing SDL2 and trying to understand how the library works etc...


Week2: Learnt to better familiarize myself with the libary, creating windows etc... Read the code of my teammates to understand how the overall game works. 

Week3-4: Added an ability to play music when game is opened using the SDL2-mixer library. Will try to now work on developping the ability to display the map when the M key is pressed and also try to add a settings button to be able to adjust settings.

Week5: Completed the display map feature. Had some difficulties due to the scaling and alot of bugs related to the scaling on my mac but managed to fix the bugs. Solved other bugs. Also added other feature to display position of current player on the map and will develop other features relating to the map shortly. Will also work on other features and solve bugs in the settings.
