Week1: I spent most of the time installing SDL2 and trying to understand how the library works etc...


Week2: Learnt to better familiarize myself with the libary, creating windows etc... Read the code of my teammates to understand how the overall game works. 

Week3-4: Added an ability to play music when game is opened using the SDL2-mixer library. Will try to now work on developping the ability to display the map when the M key is pressed and also try to add a settings button to be able to adjust settings.

Week5: Completed the display map feature. Had some difficulties due to the scaling and alot of bugs related to the scaling on my mac but managed to fix the bugs. Solved other bugs. Also added other feature to display position of current player on the map and will develop other features relating to the map shortly. Will also work on other features and solve bugs in the settings. 

Week6: Fixed the the position feauture. Had a lot of incaccuracies in the red dot displaying the correct position and finally managed to correctly display the player's position. 
 
Week7: Worked on an feauture to render the legend in the top left. It displays what every component means on the map. ALso displayed in the left bottom corner a feauture to display the player coordinates. 

Week 8: Worked on a feature to ping a location on the map and make a blue ping where the player clicks on the map. 

Issues I faced. The main issues I faced were the ones dealing with scaling the tiles correctly for it to correctly display the map in the right dimensions when displaying the map as we needed to take into account the dimension of the individual tiles. I spent a lot of time debugging some small stuff which allowed for the feautures to work correctly. Also, the map doesn't render perfectly in the main branch and we weren't able to fix it in time. All the code is in ghe game.cpp file but it doesnt work perfectly. The branch Map-Corrected has all the code and everything works perfectly.
