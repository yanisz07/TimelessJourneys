Week 1:
I finally downloaded the SDL2 library on my Mac thanks to Karel. I am following a tutorial on how to create a game using SDL2 to learn how to use the library.
This tutorial also gave me an insight into what the architecture of the game should be. in the next meeting during the lecture class we will make sure that everyone 
has SDL2 downloaded and working on their computer. I hope that this week each team will be able to make a prototype.
