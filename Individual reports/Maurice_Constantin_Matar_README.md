Week 1 Summary: 
This week, with the help of my teammate and the professor, I contributed to the set up of the SDL2 library for the project (version macOS). 

Week 2 Summary: 
This week, I learned how to create a simple game using SDL2. I read some buts of the code written by my teammates, watched some Youtube videos and discovered through them the structure needed to work with SDL2 as well as some basic things inside the library. 

Week 3 Summary: 
This week, I continued on learning on how to use SDL2. This was done mainly through Youtube. 

Week 4 Summary:
This week, I looked into how to implement textures inside the game, as well as other mechanics necessary for coding the player character. I also read and played with some of the existing code that my teammates already wrote so that I understand it more. 

Week 5 Summary: 
This week, I started working on the developement of items, specifically on how to link them to the already developped inventory. The item I'm developping is a sword, an item in the class of melee items.

Week 6 Summary: 
This week, I continued working on the developpement of items. Moreover, I was able to make appear an icon in the inventory. 

Week 7 Summary: 
This week, I continued the devloppment of new items with some of my teammates and introced them to the game (I worked for example on the health potion). Using the fact that items can now be in the inventory and in chests, I also worked on making some items usable once selected in the inventory. I also worked on some other minor adustments to other elements of the game.
